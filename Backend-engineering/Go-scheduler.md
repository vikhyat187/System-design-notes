- Goroutines are user space threads not the kernel space, so the OS scheduler cannot directly schedule them
- They have very less memory footprint
- The creation of goroutines, blocking on system call calls the scheduler
- Kernel threads are expensive
- We can use the benchmark to understand the things
- A background thread is used to understand if the thread is a blocked thread
- We can use GOMAXPROCS to set the number of kernel threads
- For the long running CPU go routines we can preempt them by ourselves and send to the global run queue
