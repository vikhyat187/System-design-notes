## Rules of the System:

Setup:
• The building has multiple floors and can have multiple elevators.
• Elevators can be called from any floor and can travel to any floor.
• Each elevator has a maximum capacity and weight limit.
• The system schedules elevator movement based on requests and optimizes for efficiency.

## Operation:

• Users can request an elevator from any floor by pressing up/down buttons.
• Inside the elevator, users can select destination floors. (There is one more type, where users can choose destination
floors outside only, but we are not covering those here !!)
• The system prioritizes and schedules these requests efficiently.
• Elevators have indicators showing current floor and direction.

## Safety Features:
• Emergency stop functionality must be available.
• Overload detection prevents elevator movement if capacity is exceeded.

• Door sensors prevent doors from closing if obstructed.
