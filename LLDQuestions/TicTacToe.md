This file has the question Tic Tac Toe LLD design

## Requirements
- the Game Should Support N * N board instead of 3 * 3
- Game modes : B/w two players or Player vs Computer
- it should allow use of more symbols except O , X
- Player Can get Rating on basis of Win | Draw . Maybe we can also reduce rating if Player loses
- Leaderboard Feature: Friends [ After having some social account connect ] , Country Wise , Global
- Undo a Change should be allowed ?
- Timer to do a move ? Maybe Penalty in rating if timer exceeds as we canâ€™t skip the chance as it would defy the purpose for the game . although if we have a large board say 20 * 20 then we can see if player chance should be skipped and other player might get a extra advantage
- Toss to Choose the Symbol
