## Requirements gathering
- the riders can book a cab
- The riders have to be matched with the drivers / cabs
- Now the riders can be matched to random drivers in their area / drivers with some rating values
- How should be the pricing model should it be constant per KM / depend on the traffic condition / charge less to the good customers?
- we should be storing the list of drivers and riders
- and a driver can enable / disable their availability, which means they can say that they are available / non availalble
