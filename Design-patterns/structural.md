- We can have the other services like video service, podcast service and other places and repeat the same code
- Podcast service also will have the same authorization check
- tight coupling
- seperate the access control from the videp streaming logic
- similar for the caching also caching should not be done on the video streaming serivce

Here the proxy service calls the actual service code here

Users interact with the proxy service and not the real service

### Real-life Use Cases of the Proxy Pattern 🌎
1. Security Proxies:
Control access to sensitive resources, ensuring only authorized users can access them.
2. Caching Proxies:
Cache frequently requested data, improving performance and reducing load on the server.
3. Virtual Proxies:
Delay the creation of expensive objects until they are actually needed.
4. Firewall Proxies:
Filter and control network traffic based on predefined rules.
